# Description

All workings can be found in the crypto_investments.ipynb. The analysis compares the k-means clustering using the original data to data where the features been reduced via Principal Components Analysis (PCA).

# Findings

After imporing and standardizing the data. We use both the original data and data where the features have been reduced via PCA to determine the optimal number of cluster.

Our results show that both methods produce 4 as the optimal number of clusters to use. Finally looking at the cluster plots (original vs. PCA), we find that the PCA clusters appear to be more pronounced than that of the original.
